## Introduction 📚

- Spam messages have plagued communication platforms for years. This project aims to combat this issue by building a basic spam detection solution. The model analyzes SMS messages and determines whether they are legitimate (ham) or spam. It's a starting point for more sophisticated approaches to handling unwanted content.

## Usage 🚀

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-detection.git
   cd sms-spam-detection
```
2. **Install Dependencies**:

- Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
```
3. **Get the Data**:

- Download the 'spam.csv' dataset from here and place it in the project directory.

4. Run the Script:

- Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
python spam_detection.py
```
5. Explore the Results:

- The script will display accuracy and precision scores, giving you insights into the model's performance.

## Installation 💻
- Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn nltk
```
## Dataset 📊
- The SMS dataset used for this project is available in the 'spam.csv' file. It contains labeled SMS messages as either 'spam' or 'ham'. The dataset is loaded and processed within the script.

## Dependencies 🛠️
- `Pandas`: Data manipulation library
- `NumPy`: Numerical computing library
- `Matplotlib`: Data visualization library
